Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
  1.	Crowdfunding Campaigns are more successful than not. Not only are there more successful campaigns than failed and cancelled combined, but also for every month the most likely outcome is a successful campaign. The median campaign backing amount is 122%.
  2.	August is the worst time to run a campaign. August has the least number of successful campaigns, the greatest number of canceled campaigns, and the 2nd greatest number of failed campaigns.
  3.	Theater/plays are the most common category of campaign. The category/sub-category has the highest number of total campaigns run, as well as the highest amount of canceled, live, failed, and successful campaigns.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
  
  This dataset may overrepresent US campaigns with 763 of the 1,000 total campaigns being located in the US.
  This dataset may overrepresent theater campaigns with 344 of the 1,000 total campaigns being for theater. It also underrepresents journalism campaigns with only 4 in the dataset.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

  Creating a new field that measured the active days of a campaign (counting the number of days between the Date Created Conversion and the Date Ending Conversion), and then charting that over the Percent Funded on scatter plot, could give us some insight as to whether   the length of campaign contributes to its success.
  
  Creating a line chart of the number of each outcome year over year can give us an idea as to whether Crowdfunding strategies are getting better or worse. I could also alert us if there was a particularly good or bad year for crowdfunding, likely as a result of external economic forces.
  
  Creating a scatter plot that featured average donation over percent funded can reveal what amount is the most successful target donation. You can then filter that by category to see what target donation is best based on the category.

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
  
  The median better summarizes the center of the data. Due to the large gap between minimums and maximums, as well as the large variances, the median give a better description as to the true center of the data. In both cases the mean is substantially larger than the median, likely due to large outliers.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
  
  There is more variability with successful campaigns as noted by the larger variance and standard deviation. This does make sense given that compared to failed campaigns there are more successful data points, a larger gap between minimum and maximum values, as well as a larger gap between the mean and median.
